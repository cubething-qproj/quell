// The idea:
// Minimum and maximum distance spheres.
// The camera tries to maintain the maximum distance,
// but collisions with physics objects will move the camera towards the minimum distance sphere.
// The camera _cannot_ clip through the minimum distance sphere and will maintain at least that much distance.
// Zoom = changing outer sphere radius.
// No need for colliders, could just cast a single ray from the player to the desired camera position.
// If there is a collision, then (smoothly) move to the collisions location.
